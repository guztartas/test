# Test Project

First of all, I would like to thank the entire team for the opportunity to participate in this technical test. A special thanks to **Sofia Paredes** for the guidance and support during this process.

I'm available to clarify any doubts regarding the implementation, structure, or decisions made throughout the project.

For more detailed information about the **backend** and **frontend** structure, you can find specific README files inside the respective folders:

- [`/backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md)
- [`/frontend/README.md`](./frontend/README.md)

Thank you once again for the opportunity!

Best regards,  
Gustavo Tartas
